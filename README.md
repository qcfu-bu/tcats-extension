# Diagnostics for ATS type checking. 

Inspired by ats-mode for emacs, this extension brings ATS error diagnostics to
VScode. The hope is to lower the barrier to entry for ATS programming as emacs
can be difficult to learn. Sparverius's ATS-Temptory syntax highlighting is also
superior to what ats-mode has in my opinion.

## Requirements 

Make sure that command `patscc` and other ATS tools are in the PATH. Please
refer to <http://www.ats-lang.org/> for detailed instruction on installing ATS.

For Windows computers, ATS installation through
[WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) is required.
